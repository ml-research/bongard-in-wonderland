Your task is to determine the position of a circle in relation to a cavity in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram shows a shape with a cavity. From inside the figure, you need to decide if the circle is on the left or the right of the cavity. Carefully analyze the diagram step-by-step to identify the correct side.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "position": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "left" if the circle is to the left of the cavity or "right" if the circle is to the right of the cavity.
