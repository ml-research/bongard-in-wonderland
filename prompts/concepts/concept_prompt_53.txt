Your task is to analyze a 2D black and white diagram where two geometric figures are shown, one inside the other. Carefully examine the number of angles of each figure.

Determine whether the inside figure has fewer or more angles compared to the outside figure. Analyze each shape step-by-step to ensure accuracy in your assessment.

Please consider your decision carefully. Once you are confident, provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "relation": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> should be either "fewer angles" if the inside figure has fewer angles than the outside figure or "more angles" if the inside figure has more angles than the outside figure.
