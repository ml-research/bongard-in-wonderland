Your task is to analyze a 2D black and white diagram containing a set of crosses and determine the nature of the shape formed by their convex hull.

The image presents crosses scattered in the diagram, and your objective is to assess whether the convex hull that envelops all the crosses forms an equilateral triangle. 

Carefully examine the arrangement and positions of the crosses to identify the geometric structure formed by their convex hull. 

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "convex_hull_shape": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "equilateral triangle" if the convex hull of the crosses forms an equilateral triangle, or "not equilateral triangle" if it does not.
