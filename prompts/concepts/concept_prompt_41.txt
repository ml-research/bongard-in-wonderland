Your task is to determine the alignment of outline circles depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram shows a series of outline circles. Your objective is to decide whether these circles appear aligned on a single straight line or not. Carefully examine the positioning of each circle in relation to the others and determine whether they form a straight line.

Take your time to analyze the diagram methodically and give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "alignment": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "on one straight line" if the circles are aligned in a straight line, or "not on one straight line" if they are not aligned.
