Prompt:

Your task is to analyze a 2D black and white diagram where the shading intensity differs across the image. You need to determine on which side of the image the shading appears thicker.

Take the time to carefully examine the shading variations across the diagram. Decide step-by-step whether the shading is more pronounced on the left or the right side. 

Please provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "thicker_shading_side": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "right" if the shading is thicker on the right side or "left" if the shading is thicker on the left side.
