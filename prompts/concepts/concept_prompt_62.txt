Prompt:

Your task is to analyze a curve depicted in a 2D black and white diagram and determine the relationship between the ends of the curve.

The given diagram shows a single continuous curve. Your goal is to decide whether the ends of the curve are far apart from each other or close together. Carefully examine the diagram, noting the relative distance between the beginning and end points of the curve.

Please consider your observation thoroughly. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "relationship": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "far apart" if the ends of the curve are distant from each other, or "close together" if they are near each other.
