Your task is to determine whether the lines depicted in a 2D black and white diagram are closed or open.

The given diagram features various lines. You need to analyze the lines carefully and decide if they form a continuous shape (closed) or if the ends of the lines are not joined (open). Examine the diagram methodically to identify the correct category of lines.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "line_type": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "closed" if the lines form a continuous loop or "open" if the lines do not form a closed shape.
