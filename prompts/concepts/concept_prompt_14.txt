Your task is to evaluate the total line length depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram contains various lines of differing lengths. Your goal is to determine whether the overall total length of these lines is considered large or small. Carefully analyze the lengths of all the lines in the diagram, adding them up step-by-step to form a precise judgment.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "line_length": <your answer>
}
```
where `<your answer>` can be either "large" if the total line length is considered large or "small" if it is considered small.
