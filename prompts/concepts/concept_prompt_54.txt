Your task is to determine the arrangement direction of three symbols — a cross, a circle, and a triangle — depicted in a 2D black and white image.

The given image displays these three symbols in a circular pattern. Starting from the cross, analyze the sequence in which the circle and the triangle are arranged. Please carefully evaluate whether these symbols follow a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around the circle.

Please decide carefully and think step-by-step. Provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "arrangement": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "counterclockwise" if the sequence is cross ➔ circle ➔ triangle in that direction or "clockwise" if the sequence is cross ➔ circle ➔ triangle in that direction.
