Your task is to determine the position of a circle in relation to a figure composed of crosses in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram features a circle and a figure constructed from cross shapes. Your objective is to decide whether the circle is situated inside or outside of the cross-formed figure. Carefully examine the diagram step-by-step to identify the circle's exact position relative to the crosses.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "position": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "inside" if the circle is within the boundaries of the cross-formed figure, or "outside" if the circle is beyond those boundaries.
