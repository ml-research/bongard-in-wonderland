Prompt:

Your task is to analyze a 2D black and white diagram where a single continuous line is drawn. The goal is to determine whether this line crosses over itself at any point.

Examine the diagram closely to identify if the line has any parts where it overlaps or intersects itself, forming a crossover. Please proceed carefully, observing the entire length of the line to make a definitive conclusion.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "self_crossing": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "yes" if the line has a self-crossing or "no" if the line does not cross itself.
