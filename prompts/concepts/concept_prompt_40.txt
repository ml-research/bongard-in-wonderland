Your task is to determine the arrangement of points in a 2D black and white diagram and identify whether any three points align in a straight line.

The given diagram shows several points placed on a plane. You need to carefully analyze the arrangement to decide if there are any three points that lie on a single straight line. Examine the diagram thoroughly, considering various combinations of points to ensure accuracy.

Please make your decision by thinking step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:
```python
answer = {
    "alignment": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "three points on a straight line" if such an alignment exists, or "no three points on a straight line" if there is no such alignment.
