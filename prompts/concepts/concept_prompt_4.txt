Your task is to determine the shape classification of a figure depicted in a 2D black and white diagram. 

The given diagram shows a geometric figure. You need to decide if the figure is convex or nonconvex. Carefully analyze the diagram step-by-step to identify the correct classification by examining the shape's boundaries and angles.

Please decide carefully whether the figure is convex or nonconvex. Take a deep breath and think systematically. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "type": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "convex" if all the interior angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees, forming a shape that bulges outward, or "nonconvex" if any angle is greater than 180 degrees, forming indentations or inward curves.
