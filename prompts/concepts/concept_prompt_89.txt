Your task is to determine the number of distinct parts in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram consists of multiple parts. Analyze the structure closely to identify the exact number of distinct parts. Carefully count the parts, being mindful of any potential overlaps or connections between them.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "number_of_parts": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "three" if the diagram consists of three parts, or "five" if the diagram consists of five parts.
