Your task is to determine the type of geometric shapes depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram contains several geometric shapes. Your goal is to identify the predominant type of shape present. Carefully analyze the diagram to decide whether the shapes are predominantly triangles or quadrangles.

Please review the image with attention to detail. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "shape_type": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "Triangles" if the shapes are predominantly triangles, or "Quadrangles" if the shapes are predominantly quadrangles.
