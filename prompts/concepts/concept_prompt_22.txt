Your task is to evaluate the relative size of areas of figures depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram shows multiple figures. You need to assess whether the areas of these figures are approximately equal or if they differ greatly. Carefully analyze the diagram, comparing the sizes step-by-step to determine the relationship between their areas.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "area_relationship": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "approximately equal" if the areas of the figures are roughly the same or "differ greatly" if there is a significant difference.
