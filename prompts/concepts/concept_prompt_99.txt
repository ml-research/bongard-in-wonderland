Your task is to assess whether the outlines of triangles and circles intersect in a 2D black and white diagram.

The provided diagram features various geometric shapes, including triangles and circles. You need to carefully examine the image to determine if any intersections occur between the outlines of these shapes. Analyze the geometric arrangement meticulously to reach a conclusion.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "intersection": <your answer>
}
```

where `<your answer>` can be either "intersect" if the outlines of triangles and circles do intersect or "do not intersect" if they do not.
