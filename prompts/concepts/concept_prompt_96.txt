Your task is to determine the type of geometric shapes represented in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram contains several polygonal shapes. Your task is to identify the type of shapes present. Carefully analyze the number of sides for each shape to determine whether they are triangles or quadrangles.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "shape_type": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "Triangles" if the shapes are triangles or "Quadrangles" if the shapes are quadrangles.
