Your task is to determine the presence of a solid black triangle in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram may or may not contain a solid black triangle. Carefully examine the image to identify if such a triangle is present. Consider the attributes like shape, color, and orientation to make your decision.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "presence": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "present" if there is a solid black triangle in the image or "absent" if a solid black triangle is not present in the image.
