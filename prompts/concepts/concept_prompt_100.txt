Your task is to identify which letter is depicted in a given 2D black and white diagram.

The diagram presents a single character which represents one of two possible letters from the Cyrillic alphabet. Carefully analyze the shape and structure of the character to determine which letter it represents.

Please decide carefully by examining the distinctive features of each letter. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "letter": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "А" if the letter in the image is the Cyrillic letter А, or "Б" if it is the Cyrillic letter Б.
