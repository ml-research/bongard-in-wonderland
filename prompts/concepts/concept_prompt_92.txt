Your task is to determine the structure of a chain depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram shows a chain-like structure. You need to carefully analyze the structure to decide if the chain branches or if it remains unbranched. Examine the diagram step-by-step to identify the correct structural characteristic of the chain.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "structure": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "unbranched" if the chain does not branch, or "branched" if the chain branches.
