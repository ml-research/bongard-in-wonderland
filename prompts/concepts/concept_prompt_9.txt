Your task is to determine the type of contour present in a 2D black and white image.

The given image depicts a figure, and your challenge is to distinguish whether the contour of this figure is smooth or twisting. Carefully analyze the lines and edges of the figure step-by-step to identify the nature of its contour.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "contour": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "smooth" if the contour appears even and flowing, or "twisting" if the contour appears irregular or winding.
