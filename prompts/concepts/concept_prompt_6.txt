Your task is to determine the type of geometric shapes predominantly depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram features a series of geometric shapes. You need to identify whether the shapes are primarily triangles or quadrangles. Examine the number of sides the shapes have to make your determination.

Please examine the diagram carefully and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "shape_type": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "triangles" if the shapes predominantly have three sides or "quadrangles" if they have four sides.
