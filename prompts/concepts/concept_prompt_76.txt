Your task is to determine the shape of the long sides of a figure depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram shows a geometric shape characterized by two long sides. Your objective is to decide whether these long sides are concave or convex. Analyze the diagram carefully by examining the curvature of the long sides.

Please decide carefully whether the long sides are concave or convex. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "curvature": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "concave" if the long sides are inward curving or "convex" if they are outward curving.
