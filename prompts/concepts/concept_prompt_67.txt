Your task is to analyze a diagram and determine the relative starting positions of the branches on either side.

The given diagram includes two branches, one on the left and one on the right. Your task is to observe both branches and identify which one begins at a higher point. Carefully inspect the diagram, considering the beginning points of both branches, to ascertain their relative vertical positions.

Please ensure your decision is thorough and precise. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "position": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "higher" if the right branch begins at a higher point than the left branch, or "lower" if the right branch begins at a lower point than the left branch.
