Your task is to determine whether an angle depicted in a 2D black and white diagram is equally divided by a line.

The given diagram illustrates a geometric angle with a line that may or may not divide the angle into two equal parts. Your task is to analyze the diagram and decide if the line bisects the angle into two equal halves or not. Look at the measurements or visual cues to make your determination.

Please decide carefully by examining the relationships and proportions. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "angle_divided": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "half" if the angle is divided in half, or "not half" if the angle is not divided in half.
