Your task is to determine the presence or absence of second-order side branches in a structural diagram.

The given diagram displays a tree-like structure. Your objective is to ascertain whether there are any side branches extending from the primary branches, which we refer to as second-order side branches. Carefully examine the diagram to identify if such branches exist.

Take your time to thoroughly analyze each branch structure in the image. Please give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "second_order_side_branches": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "absence" if there are no side branches of the second order, or "presence" if there are side branches of the second order.
