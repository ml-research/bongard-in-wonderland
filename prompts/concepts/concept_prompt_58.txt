Your task is to assess whether two solid dark quadrangles depicted in a 2D black and white image are identical or different.

The given image showcases two solid dark quadrilateral shapes. Examine the shapes carefully to determine if they are identical in terms of shape, orientation, and size, or if there are any differences between them.

Please make your determination carefully. Take a deep breath and analyze the image systematically. Provide your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "identicality": <your answer>
}
```
where `<your answer>` can be either "identical" if the quadrangles are the same or "different" if there are any differences between them.
