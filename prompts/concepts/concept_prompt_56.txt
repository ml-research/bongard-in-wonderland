Your task is to determine the color relationship among figures depicted in a 2D diagram.

The given diagram includes multiple figures that may vary in color. You need to decide whether all the figures are of the same color or the figures are of different colors. Carefully analyze the diagram step-by-step to identify the correct color pattern.

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "color_relationship": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "same" if all figures are of the same color or "different" if the figures are of different colors.
