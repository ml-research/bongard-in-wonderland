Your task is to determine the positional relationship between a triangle and a circle depicted in a 2D black and white diagram.

The given diagram features two primary shapes: a triangle and a circle. Carefully analyze the diagram to determine which shape is positioned on top of the other.

Please decide carefully whether the triangle is on top of the circle or the circle is on top of the triangle. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:

```python
answer = {
    "position": <your answer>
}
```

where <your answer> can be either "triangle on top" if the triangle is positioned above the circle, or "circle on top" if the circle is positioned above the triangle.
