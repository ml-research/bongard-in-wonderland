Your task is to determine the relative position of two objects in a 2D black and white diagram. 
The given diagram shows a triangle and a circle. Which of the shapes is located above the other, i.e., has a higher y-value than the other?

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:
```
answer = {
    "shape": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "triangle" if the triangle is above the circle or "circle" if the circle is above the triangle.
