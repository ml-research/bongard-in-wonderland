You are provided with a black-and-white image consisting of 12 simple diagrams. Each diagram represents shapes with specific features, such as geometric properties or higher-level concepts.

- The 6 diagrams on the left side belong to Set A.
- The 6 diagrams on the right side belong to Set B.

## Task

Propose multiple distinct hypotheses explaining how the diagrams in Set A might share a common rule (or set of rules) that does not apply to Set B, and vice versa. In other words, each hypothesis should outline:

1. A feature or rule that unifies all 6 diagrams in Set A
2. A different feature or rule that unifies all 6 diagrams in Set B

These rules must be mutually exclusive—whatever defines Set A must not be true for Set B, and vice versa. You may consider a variety of factors, like shape type, number or count of shapes, orientation, symmetry, color usage, line style, or any other relevant factor — but only in the context of the 6 images of each set.

## Answer Format

1. Return your hypotheses as a Python list of pairs of strings.
2. Each list element should be a tuple `(rule_for_Set_A, rule_for_Set_B)`.
3. For example:
```python
    [
        ("All the diagrams contain at least one triangular shape", "There exists no triangular shape in the diagrams"),
        ("Each diagram features a single shape that is positioned in the bottom half of the diagram", "Each diagram features a single shape that is positioned in the upper half of the diagram"),
        ...
    ]
```
4. Ensure each rule is clear, specific and unique.
5. Avoid stating which hypothesis seems most likely or correct; simply propose a variety of possibilities.

## Additional Guidelines

- Each hypothesis should stand on its own and be mutually exclusive to the other set.
- Be creative, but only base your statements on plausible observations from the 12 diagrams.
- Provide 20 distinct, well-defined hypotheses.
