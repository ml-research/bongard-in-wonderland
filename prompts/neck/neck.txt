Your task is to determine the orientation of a pinch or neck in a 2D black and white diagram. 
The given diagram shows a shape that has a pinch in the middle. The pinch connects the both ends of the shapes and can be interpreted as a bridge as well. Which orientation does this pinch have, horizontal or vertical?

Please decide carefully. Take a deep breath and think step-by-step. Give your answer in the following format:
```
answer = {
    "orientation": <your answer>
}
```
where <your answer> can be either "horizontal" if the bridge is aligned horizontal or "vertical" if the bridge is aligned vertical.
