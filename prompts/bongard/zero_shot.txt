You are provided with a black-and-white image consisting of 12 simple diagrams. Each diagram represents shapes with specific features, such as geometric properties or higher-level concepts.

- The 6 diagrams on the left side belong to Set A.
- The 6 diagrams on the right side belong to Set B.

## Task:

Your task is to determine two distinct rules:

1. Set A Rule: Identify a rule that applies to all diagrams in Set A.
2. Set B Rule: Identify a separate rule that applies to all diagrams in Set B.

Important: The rule for Set A must not apply to any diagram in Set B, and the rule for Set B must not apply to any diagram in Set A.

## Step-by-Step Process:

1. Diagram Analysis: Carefully describe each diagram in detail, noting any geometric properties, patterns, or conceptual features.
2. Rule Derivation: Based on your analysis, deduce the rule for Set A and the rule for Set B, ensuring that each rule is unique to its set.

## Final Answer Format:

Provide the final answer using the following format:

```python

answer = {
    'set A rule': '[LEFT RULE]',
    'set B rule': '[RIGHT RULE]'
}
```

Ensure that the rules are clearly defined, concise, and do not overlap between the sets.
